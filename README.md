# TernPopulationDynamics

A metapopulation dynamics model for Roseate Terns (_Sterna dougallii_).  It is based on a register of observations from the endangered northwest Atlantic metapopulation. The objective of this model is to capture the dynamics driving the establishment and abandonment of breeding colonies of Roseate Terns.
